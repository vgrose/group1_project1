# Effect of Healthcare Quality on Happiness

The link between health and happiness is one of the best-documented in the study of well-being. In this study we want to examine how much a country’s healthcare system, including access to care, affordability, and quality of care affects the country’s overall level of happiness.

* Happiness is highest correlated with life expectancy. Both measures are highest in western europe and lowest in sub-saharan africa.

* Availability of medical care is the second highest correlate with overall happiness. Of the 4 aspects of healthcare quality we examined, number of physicians and nurses/midwives per capita correlated with happiness. This suggests that availability and accessibility of medical resources contributes to overall happiness.

* Lowest happiness level is observed in a sub-saharan country with low life expectancy and relativel high medical expenditure (~9.5% GDP). Additionally, the health care expenditure in the United States (far right orange bubble) is not proportional to the happiness and life expectancy. High medical expenditure does not necessarily lead to higher medical quality, higher life expectancy, or higher overall happiness.
